- **Acknowledge Uncertainty**: It's okay to say "I'm not sure" or "this is a judgmental area"

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

### Consequences

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.
